		<h2>What's Bolt?</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/boltjs/bolt" class="dot" target="_blank">Bolt</a> (formerly pyarn) is a javascript module system that consists of a runtime framework, compiler and testing tools. It's a command line interface, so the logo isn't featured in the product itself, but still needs to represent the project and engage users. More importantly, it's a project from my dear friend and colleague, James Kyle, who I had worked closely with for many years at Cloudflare. James and I were design and engineering partners there, and have remained close friends since. I have always had a blast working with him, so when he asked me if I would be interested in making a logo for his latest project, I jumped at the chance.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>After getting the rights to the name Bolt, we were ready to get started. It was important that this logo go well with another one of James' projects: <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" class="dot" target="_blank">Yarn</a>. He wanted the two logos to compliment one another, but also wanted Bolt to contrast with Yarn's cute kitten logo, to create some dynamic visual magic.</p>
			<p>The logo they had been using as a placeholder was a nice, bright pink that complimented Yarn's pretty electric blue really well, and we both wanted to keep that color and run with it. I began by sketching out a few concepts that I thought would tie Bolt and Yarn well together and make good use of the color. I also wanted to play around with some overlapping between the two to create a nice purple, making the two really blend together and make something new altogether.</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>With the later colorized versions, I felt I was on to something and got excited about the idea of yarn wrapping a bolt needle. I took this concept and ran with it. We weren't quite done, but I was ready to share the concept with James and his team. I put together a quick presentation running down some of the concepts and where we were headed. You can peep that presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XW1vThy7J0DftzMHqwbQBcs75sIY0SckDH2zRmx3mOw/edit?usp=sharing" class="dot" target="_blank">right here</a>. The team loved the concept, so with their approval, I got to work refining the logo. One of the great things about working with James is that he has a good design eye himself, and we collaborate well. Together we picked apart the logo and refined areas of overlap to create the final version of the logo.</p>
